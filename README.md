# Precept

A modern C++ graphics library.

__Precept__ is a collection of C++20 header-only utilities, which contains general-use, boilerplate interfaces as well as more specific (yet type-generic) data structures and algorithms for use in CPU-based graphics programming and image processing. This includes multi-dimensional arrays and array views, memory allocation strategies, and binary object serialization helpers.

This repository also contains **Precept-graphics**, which is an extension library that implements more concrete and specific data structures and algorithms, for dealing with images and bounding box trees for example. While this is also designed to be as generic as possible, it is intended to be built as a static library and thus is _not_ header-only.
